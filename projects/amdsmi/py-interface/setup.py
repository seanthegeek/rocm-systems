# The wheel bundles a prebuilt libamd_smi_python.so and loads it via ctypes.
# It carries no Python C-extension, so it is ABI-independent across CPython
# versions (py3-none) but platform-specific (the .so is glibc/arch bound).
# Setuptools would otherwise tag it py3-none-any, which lets pip install it on
# any platform and then fail at load time. Force a non-pure, py3-none wheel so
# the platform tag reflects the bundled .so; auditwheel later stamps the
# concrete manylinux tag.
