// Static indirect branch recovery has to answer a narrow CFG question:
// for each s_setpc_b64 or s_swappc_b64, can we prove the source SGPR pair
// contains a concrete text offset built from s_getpc_b64? If yes, BasicBlock
// can model that target as either an ordinary successor or a context-sensitive
// call edge. If no, the safest answer is silence: do not add a guessed edge,
// and let later translation diagnostics deal with any still-unhandled indirect
// branch.
//
// The pass is split into four phases.
//
// Phase 1 - Decode cheap instruction facts and build an analysis block graph.
// The graph contains only direct CFG edges: direct branches, direct calls, and
// ordinary fallthrough. Recovered indirect edges are intentionally absent at
// this point, otherwise the analysis would be using the result it is trying to
// prove. The caller-provided extra leaders are included because kernel entry
// boundaries are real CFG cut points for later BasicBlock construction.
//
// Phase 2 - Scan each analysis block once. The local state tracks only SGPR
// pairs that currently hold a PC builder. At the end of the block, the scan
// produces a per-pair transfer summary:
//   * SET(value): this block leaves the pair holding a complete concrete PC.
//   * KILL: this block writes the pair in a way the analysis does not model.
//   * PASS: this block did not touch the pair, so incoming facts flow through.
// Consumers that resolve inside their own block emit fixups immediately.
// Consumers whose source pair is pristine in the block are deferred to Phase 4,
// because their value, if any, must come from predecessors.
//
// Phase 3 - Run bounded forward dataflow over block summaries. The lattice is:
//
//   map<sgpr_pair_low, {set<PcValue>, incomplete, killed}>
//
// `incomplete` means at least one predecessor path is unconstrained, killed, or
// over the target cap. `killed` records the specific case where a predecessor
// reached this point after an unmodeled write to the pair. Concrete values are
// still useful when incompleteness came from path-insensitive CFG joins:
// generated kernels often build a small return-address set in a dispatcher and
// then jump into a shared body, but the syntactic CFG can also contain infeasible
// paths into that body. We therefore emit bounded concrete values when only
// incomplete=true, but fail closed when killed=true or when the value set is
// saturated because either case may hide the real branch target.
//
// Phase 4 - Revisit deferred consumers and emit fixups when their block entry
// fact contains a bounded concrete target set. Multiple concrete values are
// allowed up to the cap. BasicBlock will decide whether each recovered target
// is a CFG successor or a call edge.
//
// The four phases run to a small fixed point. The first round uses only direct
// CFG edges. Later rounds add already-proven recovered edges to the temporary
// graph, then rerun the same transfer/dataflow formulation. This is needed for
// nested helper code such as "build return PC A; branch to helper; helper
// setpc A; later setpc B", where discovering the first setpc edge exposes the
// path that proves the second one. If a round has no pending inter-block
// consumers, dataflow is skipped entirely because local block scanning already
// found everything that can be found in that graph.
//
// Important invariants:
//   * PC-builder facts do not cross an analysis block by carrying local state.
//     Cross-block propagation exists only through PairTransfer and the lattice.
//   * Any unrecognized write to either half of a relevant SGPR pair is a KILL.
//   * Direct s_call_b64 is a call boundary for this analysis. The temporary CFG
//     keeps both the callee edge and the fallthrough continuation edge so
//     reachability is not lost, but register effects from the callee are not
//     modeled interprocedurally. Therefore every carried PC-builder fact is
//     killed at a direct call instead of being allowed to flow straight into the
//     continuation.
//   * s_setpc_b64/s_swappc_b64 read their source pair; they do not destroy it.
//     A real kernel may build one callee address once and call it multiple
//     times. Only the swappc destination pair is killed because it receives a
//     return PC, not an editable target builder.
//   * Return PCs from s_call/s_swappc are not modeled as branch targets. They
//     are hardware return addresses, and treating them as normal getpc builders
//     would create edges that can jump across unrelated kernel regions.
