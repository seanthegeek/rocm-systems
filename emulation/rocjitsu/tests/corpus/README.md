# RocJITsu corpus policy

`gfx1250_b0_a0_semantic_tests.json` selects semantic programs whose instruction
forms have implemented runtime translations. The companion
`gfx1250_b0_a0_semantic_rewrites.json` pins the exact positive offline rewrite
count for every selected executable.

Four source-coverage programs are intentionally outside this qualification
until their translations are implemented:

- `barrier_signal_isfirst_test`
- `fp8_e5m3_pack_test`
- `wmma_split_f16_test`
- `wmma_split_fp4_test`

The offline translator currently rejects those forms as unsupported. They are
not silently accepted or treated as passing translations.
